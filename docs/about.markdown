My name is Gordon Cassie. I began my career as a securities lawyer but within a few years stumbled into
the world of software development.  From 2013 to 2020 I worked on [Closing Folders](https://www.closingfolders.com),
 a SaaS product to help corporate lawyers run complex legal transactions. In 2020 we sold the business to
[iManage](https://www.imanage.com) where I now continue to head-up the Closing Folders technical team.

Professionally, I like nerding out about how to build high performing software development teams. Unprofessionally, I
like nerding out about gardening, Fred Astaire movies and real-time tactics video games.

I live with my wife Lyndsey and our three kids in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
